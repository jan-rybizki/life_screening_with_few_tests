How could we test the true covid19 contamination with limited test capacity

In the example notebook I assume that probes can be mixed and the covid19 test would still work.
If thats true then 100 tests on superprobes which are each made up of 1000 different (randomly chosen) people is enough to determine the true contamination rate to about 20%.
